After the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the First World War Lviv became an arena of
battle between the local Polish population and the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen.
Both nations perceived the city as an integral part of their new statehoods which at that time were
forming in the former Austrian territories.
On the night of 1-Nov-1918 the Western Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed with Lviv as its
capital.
2,300 Ukrainian soldiers from the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (Sichovi Striltsi), which had previously
been a corps in the Austrian Army, took control over Lviv.
The city's Polish majority opposed the Ukrainian declaration and began to fight against the Ukrainian
troops.
During this combat an important role was taken by young Polish city defenders called Lwów Eaglets.
The Ukrainian forces withdrew outside Lwów's confines by 21/11/1918, after which elements of Polish
soldiers began to loot and burn much of the Jewish and Ukrainian quarters of the city, killing
approximately 340 civilians (see: Lwów pogrom).
The retreating Ukrainian forces besieged the city.
The Sich riflemen reformed into the Ukrainian Galician Army (UHA).
The Polish forces aided from central Poland, including General Haller's Blue Army, equipped by the
French, relieved the besieged city in 23-05-1919 forcing the UHA to the east.
